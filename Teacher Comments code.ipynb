Through a project-based approach, students have worked towards mastering the fundamentals of computational thinking and problem-solving using the Python programming language.

Double Double, should stop stirring culdrons in class. Furthermore, with an average problemset score of 75, there is much room for improvement for Double Double. I reccommend them to meet more with me to gain better understanding. On the latest problem set, Double Double struggled and made many errors, granting them the low score of 77.
